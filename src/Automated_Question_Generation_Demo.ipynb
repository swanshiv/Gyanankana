        "\t\"Determination of pH is one of the important objectives in biological treatment of the wastewater. In anaerobic treatment, if the pH goes below 5 due to excess accumulation of acids, the process is severely affected. Shifting of pH beyond 5 to 10 upsets the aerobic treatment of the wastewater. In these circumstances, the pH is generally adjusted by addition of suitable acid or alkali to optimize the treatment of the wastewater. pH value or range is of immense importance for any chemical reaction. A chemical shall be highly effective at a particular pH. Chemical coagulation, disinfection, water softening and corrosion control are governed by pH adjustment. Lower value of pH below 4 will produce sour taste and higher value above 8.5 a bitter taste. Higher values of pH hasten the scale formation in water heating apparatus and also reduce the germicidal potential of chlorine.\"\n",

While on the other end is not more than 1M of hydroxide ions which results in a pH value of not more than 14. The pH value goes out of the 0-14 range when the concentration of the solution exceeds 1M.\"\n",
